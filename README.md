The goal of this project is to explore and find unexpected trends in how much companies have been sold for over the past 15 years. Traditionally, key cash flow metrics such as EBITDA (soon to be defined) and revenue, along with capital structure and risk, are the primary tools used throughout the finance world to determine how much a company is worth and ultimately sold for to a buyer. My hope is to better understand how a variety of variables, such as total headcount, geographical location, industry, total debt, and others impact a company's value. I am particularly interested in what metrics can be used to predict the value of a company per employee (a "per capita" value of sorts) to see if there are interesting trends among the companies that have a small number of employees but a high company value.

In addition to various visualizations, I plan to utilize a variety of different methods to see if I can train model to predict the value of a company based various factors. 

I have included a variable guide (Section 1) to help someone from a none finance background understand the variables used in this analysis. 

Data for this project currently is pulled from Capital IQ (In compliance with UVA's license with Capital IQ). Please note that due to this license the raw data is not available. 

I am using this project as a showcase for skills I am learning as a graduate student in University of Virginiaâ€™s Master of Science in Data Science and will continuously update the project with new methods and tools I learn about in the program.

Thank you!
